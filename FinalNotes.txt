In Linux, a synopsis is a concise, formal description of a command's syntax, which is found in its manual (man) page. It acts as a quick reference that shows all the possible ways a command can be invoked, including its mandatory and optional arguments and options.

git branch => a branch is like a timeline

git branch branchname

git checkout branchname


If you are on the branch you want to rename, use the -m (move) flag with the new name: 
sh
git branch -m <new-name>
Use code with caution.

If you are on a different branch (e.g., main or master) and want to rename another local branch, provide both the old and new names: 
sh
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>


You can use git switch or git checkout

Commit before switchine to another branch

git branch -d branchname => deletes the btanch

git checkout -b footer
The -b option is a convenience flag used with git checkout to create and switch to a new branch in a single command



Merging = combining changes, not deleting the branch.

git branch shows all your local branches.

You need to manually delete branches you no longer need.
