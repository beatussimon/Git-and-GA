Git log will give you the logs about your commits
A Linux log is a computer-generated text file that records events and activities happening within the operating system, its applications, and other services. They serve as a vital source of information for administrators and developers. 

The --onaline option gives you the abstract view of the logs

Atomc commits => one commit 1 bug, or 1 issue 
For the commit message give it present but imperative tense for instance do this do that

Git ignore you dont want to push api keys and passwords into your tracked changes
In Linux, a synopsis is a concise, formal description of a command's syntax, which is found in its manual (man) page. It acts as a quick reference that shows all the possible ways a command can be invoked, including its mandatory and optional arguments and options. 

Every commit is based on previous commits
Command comma gives you the option to go and edit ehich hidden files you want to show in vscode 


git config => --global user.name/ user.email or core.editor

git log 
gi log --oneline
git branch => a branch is like a timeline

git branch branchname

git checkout branchname


If you are on the branch you want to rename, use the -m (move) flag with the new name: 
sh
git branch -m <new-name>
Use code with caution.

If you are on a different branch (e.g., main or master) and want to rename another local branch, provide both the old and new names: 
sh
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>


You can use git switch or git checkout

Commit before switchine to another branch

git branch -d branchname => deletes the btanch

git checkout -b footer
The -b option is a convenience flag used with git checkout to create and switch to a new branch in a single command



Merging = combining changes, not deleting the branch.

git branch shows all your local branches.

You need to manually delete branches you no longer need.

Git diff shows you the differrences in the same fie, the differrence between time x and time y of the same file though

git diff and git diff filename does nothing you must provide options to see its usability for instance --staged will show you the difference between when the dile file was staged and afer staging 


IMPORtANT conflicting changes are not allowed to switch the branch without commiting changes, to switch to another branch and go on with working on the other branch you must stash yout changes and then stash apply after stash pop 

Note: if you use switch and -c option it creates a naw branch and then switches youo to it

When you have some changes which have not even been stages and you need to move to another branch thats where you need to stadh the changes

Stashed changes can be moved to a different file  fot instance if i stashed my changes in one branch i can pop them in my main branch 


git stashist shows you the list of stashes

You can run the commands like git stash apply

sTASH IS MEANT TO BE VERY TEMPORARY

stash pop brings baxk the changes WHILE git stash apply soes apply changes and keep the changes in the stash 

You can go to a speciefic commit by git checkout then the commit id whether the full or the minified one 
This will cause the head to point at that commit


Git reflog => this command moves where you were previously
